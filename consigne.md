1 - Introduction

This project is based (inspired and adapted) on the "Laying Grass" game, from The Devil's Plan (데블스 플랜) Netflix reality game show (episode 8).

It has to be realized by groups of maximum 2 students in 2 weeks, and is mostly based on what you have seen during this course but some parts may need a little research to complete. One and only one group of 3 is allowed if and only if the class has an odd number of students and all other groups have 2 members.

You are obviously not allowed to copy or adapt an existing code, or share information with other groups.

Failure to comply with the above instructions or the delivery rules will result in a grade of 0.



2 - Presentation
In Laying Grass, players must place grass tiles on a grid-based territory board to expand their territory, with the goal of creating the largest square territory.



The game will be played by 2 to 9 players, with the order of play determined randomly. From 2 to 4 players, the grid will be 20x20 squares; from 5 to 9, 30x30.

At the end, the player who manages to cover the largest square (ex: 7x7) is declared the winner. In case of a tie, the greatest number of grass squares in the territory will be considered.





3 - Process
3.1 - Start
Players will be able to enter a name and choose a color.

Once the game begins, all players will each receive a 1x1 starting tile. Players will place this tile as their starting location.

Additionally, all players will receive one tile exchange coupon.

3.2 - Tiles
Tiles of different shapes are defined in a predetermined (but random) order. There are 96 possible tiles, but only 10.67 tiles will be available per player (rounded), ex: 43 for 4 players.



On their turns, players will receive the first grass tile from the upcoming tiles queue.

By using a tile exchange coupon, instead of the first tile in the upcoming queue, the players may choose one tile from the next five tiles. The tile next in order of the one chosen by the player becomes the tile of the next player. The tiles preceding the chosen tile will come back into play once all the other tiles have been used up (in the same order).



When players receive their first tile, they must place it so it touches at least one side of their starting tile. Going forward, the group of tiles in contact with a player's starting tile becomes their territory. Grass tiles that are placed down, must be touching the player's territory on at least one side. Once a tile is placed, it may not be moved. Tiles cannot overlap. Tiles can be turned in any direction, or even flipped over to the other side.





When placing tiles, they may not touch other players' territory tiles.



If the player is unable to play the tile, it is discarded and the player skips his/her turn.

3.3 - End of game
The game will last for a total of nine rounds (9 played tiles per player).

At the very end, players may pay a tile exchange coupon to buy a 1x1 grass tile. Players may place it (or them) as they wish on the territory table

3.4 - Bonus squares
On the board, there are squares that grant special benefits. Players may receive their bonus by placing tiles on the four cardinal directions surrounding the squares. Then, that square becomes part of the player's territory.

Tile exchange square: the player receives one tile exchange coupon. (There are 1.5 squares of this type per player, rounded up).
Stone square: the player may place one stone tile on any empty space. Other tiles may not be placed where the stone tiles are, and stone tiles do not count as any player's territory. To remove stone tiles, players must pay one tile exchange coupon. (There is 0.5 square of this type per player, rounded up).
Robbery square: the player may choose one tile from another player and add it to their own territory. (There is 1 square of this type per player).
Stone and robbery square must be used immediately upon acquisition. Bonuses are randomly distributed on the board at the beginning (but not against an edge or another bonus). It is possible to cover a bonus with a tile, but it becomes lost.
